I just launched a blog, powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Jekyll is a static site generator and blog publishing system that converts content in a markup language (Markdown, in this case) and renders it via layouts into static sites. I'm familiar enough with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, but totally new to the details behind actually *hosting* a website, and I'm hoping Jekyll will make that process easier and more seamless as this site grows and gains content. Look for new blog posts soon as I keep learning!
